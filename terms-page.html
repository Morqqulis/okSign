							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">OVERVIEW OF THE OKSIGN SERVICES<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">okSign provides a service that allows Customers to electronically sign documents‍ and mint the completed documents as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on blockchain technology.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">USE AND ACCESS RIGHTS<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">oKSign is an open source project under MIT license. A hosted deployment offers a Limited License. Subject to these Terms, okSign grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and access the okSign Services for its business purposes as expressly permitted in these Terms. Your use and access to the Services are subject to any limitations set forth in an applicable order form, online plan or the Service Specific Terms (whether paid or free, collectively “Subscription Plan”).</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. okSign may provide Customer with a okSign Service for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscriptions”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage okSign Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Releases”), which are optional for Customer to use. This Section will apply to any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases (even if Beta Releases are provided for a fee or counts towards Customer’s Subscription Plan) and supersedes any contrary provision in these Terms. okSign may use good faith efforts in its discretion to assist Customer with Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases. Nevertheless, and without limiting the other disclaimers and limitations in these Terms, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT ANY FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION OR BETA RELEASES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, SLA, OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CUSTOMER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH okSign WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF BETA RELEASES ARE AT CUSTOMER’S SOLE RISK. okSign makes no promises that future versions of Beta Releases will be released or will be available under the same commercial or other terms. okSign may terminate Customer’s right to use any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time for any reason or no reason in okSign’s sole discretion, without liability</li>
								</ul>

							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">OWNERSHIP AND FEEDBACK<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Customer Data. As between the parties, Customer retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to the content and documents that Customer uploads into the okSign Service (excluding any okSign intellectual property) (the “Customer Data”). Customer hereby grants okSign a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify, and create derivative works of the Customer Data to the extent necessary to provide the okSign Service or as otherwise permitted in these Terms. Customer expressly authorizes okSign to use and process Customer Data (including any Confidential Information contained therein) as described in these Terms and in the okSign Privacy Policy, which provides for, but is not limited to, delivering and sharing of content and documents as directed by Customer’s use of the okSign Services with third parties (e.g. individuals/legal entities) that Customer invites to view, approve or sign such contents and documents. These licenses and permissions extend to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Aggregate/Anonymous Data. Customer agrees that okSign will have the right to generate aggregate or anonymous data and that aggregate or anonymous data is owned by okSign, which okSign may use for any business purpose during or after the term of this Agreement (including without limitation to develop and improve okSign’s products and services and to create and distribute reports and other materials). For clarity, okSign will only disclose aggregate or anonymous data externally in a de-identified (anonymous) form that does not identify Customer, Authorized Users, or end users, and that is stripped of all persistent or personal identifiers. Customer is not responsible for okSign’s use of aggregate or anonymous data.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Feedback. If Customer elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas or other feedback or related materials to okSign (collectively, “Feedback”), Customer hereby grants okSign a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any Feedback in any format and in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. Nothing in these Terms limits okSign’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">okSign Privacy Policy. The information you provide to us or that we collect will be used as described in these Terms and in the okSign Privacy Policy (currently available at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oksign.app/privacy" rel="noreferrer">www.okSign.app/privacy</a>). Please carefully read the okSign Privacy Policy as it contains important details about our collection, use and retention of information.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Security. okSign protects your information from unauthorized use or disclosure by taking reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure our systems from unauthorized access, use or modification.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Customer data limitations. This Agreement constitutes Customer’s instructions to okSign to Process Customer Data. okSign, okSign personnel and its Subcontractors will only Process, access, use, store, and transfer Customer Data as Customer instructs in order to deliver the Services and to fulfill okSign’s obligations in the Agreement. The categories of Personal Data to be processed by okSign and the processing activities to be performed under this Agreement are set out in the Data Processing Agreement. okSign will inform Customer of any legal requirement which prevents it from complying with Customer’s instructions, unless prohibited from doing so by applicable law or on important grounds of public interest. Any okSign personnel who have access to Customer Data will be bound by appropriate confidentiality obligations.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">Data Transfers.<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Data Transfer. Customer agrees that okSign and its Subcontractors may transfer Customer Data to and access, use, and store Customer Data in locations other than Customer's country.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Data Processing Agreement. To the extent Customer Data is subject to EU Data Protection Laws and is processed by okSign on Customer's behalf, Customer and okSign agree to the Data Processing Agreement. The Data Processing Agreement applies only to the Services, and does not apply to Beta Services.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Programs. okSign is certified and complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Programs, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EEA, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (to the extent it is no longer part of the EEA) to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield. If the Privacy Shield Programs are invalidated, okSign will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with alternate or successor data transfer mechanisms.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">PAYMENT TERMS<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Subscription Plan. The prices, features, and options of the okSign Services depend on the Subscription Plan selected by Customer (including any usage or overage fees). okSign does not guarantee that your particular Subscription Plan will be offered indefinitely. We reserve the right to change the prices, features, or options included in a particular Subscription Plan without notice, provided that such changes shall not take effect until your next applicable subscription term.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Recurring Charges and Upgrades. By signing up for a Subscription Plan, Customer authorizes okSign to charge Customer’s payment method on a recurring basis (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or yearly depending on Customer’s Subscription Plan) without an invoice. Customer expressly authorizes okSign to charge its payment method (such as a credit card) for the applicable subscription charges, any usage or overage charges, and any and all applicable taxes and fees. Such authorization is effective until the end of the Subscription Term and any applicable Renewal Term, or until Customer cancels all of its subscriptions.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Taxes. okSign’s fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Customer must pay any applicable sales, use, VAT, GST, excise, withholding, or similar taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of okSign. Customer will not deduct any applicable taxes from the payments to okSign, except as required by law. If such deduction is required by law, Customer will increase the amount payable as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings, okSign receives and retains (free from any such liabilities) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Auto-renewals and Trials. IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO-RENEWAL OR IS IN A TRIAL PERIOD AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED A METHOD OF PAYMENT TO okSign FOR THE SERVICES, okSign MAY CHARGE YOU AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS YOU NOTIFY okSign THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">No Refunds. Subscription and usage or overage fees (and any other fees associated with the services, including higher subscription fees for upgrades) are non-refundable and non-creditable, except where required by law. okSign subscriptions may be cancelled, and such cancellations take effect at the end of your then-current subscription term (for example, if you are on a paid monthly subscription the cancellation will take effect the following month, but if you are on a paid yearly subscription the cancellation will take effect the following year). Once your cancellation is effective, you will be downgraded to a free plan and will lose subscription features and functionality. If you don’t pay for your subscription(s) on time, we reserve the right to suspend you or remove subscription features.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">TERM AND TERMINATION<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Term. These Terms are effective until all Subscription Terms for the okSign Services have expired or are terminated as expressly permitted herein.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Subscription Term and Renewals. Customer agrees to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term. Customer cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 9.4 (Termination for Cause). If no subscription start date is specified on the applicable order form, the subscription starts when Customer first obtains access to the applicable okSign Service. Each Subscription Term will automatically renew for additional successive periods equal to the initial subscription (e.g. if Customer has an annual plan then the subscription will renewal for an additional 12 month term, if Customer has a monthly plan then the subscription will renewal for additional month terms) unless: (i) otherwise stated on the applicable order form; or (ii) either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current Subscription Term. Pricing for any Subscription Term renewal, new order form, or order form changes will be at okSign’s then-applicable rates.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Suspension of Service. okSign may suspend Customer’s access to the okSign Services if: (i) Customer’s account is overdue; or (ii) Customer has exceeded its service allocations / service limits. okSign may also suspend Customer’s access to the okSign Services or remove Customer Data if it determines that: (a) Customer has breached any portion of these Terms, or (b) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the okSign Service. okSign will have no liability for taking action as permitted above. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer will remain responsible for payment of fees during any suspension period under this Section 9.3. However, unless these Terms have been terminated, okSign will cooperate with Customer to promptly restore access to the okSign Service once we verify that Customer has resolved the condition requiring suspension.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate these Terms, including any related order form, if the other party: (i) fails to cure any material breach of these Terms (including a failure to pay undisputed fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (ii) ceases operation without a successor; or (iii) if permitted by applicable law, seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any of these proceedings are instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms or an order form: (i) Customer’s license rights terminate and it must promptly: (a) stop use of the applicable okSign Service; (b) delete (or, at okSign’s request, return) any and all copies of any okSign code, documentation, passwords or access codes, and any other okSign Confidential Information in Customer’s possession, custody, or control; and (ii) Customer’s right to access any Customer Data in the applicable okSign Service will cease and okSign may delete the Customer Data at any time after 30 days from the date of termination. If okSign terminates these Terms for cause as provided in Section 9.4 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Customer. Except where these Terms specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under these Terms, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of these Terms: 2.2 (Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions); 3 (Ownership and Feedback); 5 (Payment Terms); 6 (Term and Termination); 8 (Warranties and Disclaimers); 9 (Indemnification Obligations); 10 (Limitations of Liability); 11 (Third-Party Products and Integrations); and 15 (General).</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Confidential Information “Confidential Information” means (a) for okSign, the okSign Services and Documentation; (b) for Customer, Customer Data; (c) any other information of a party that is disclosed in writing or orally and is designated as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure (and, in the case of oral disclosures, summarized in writing within thirty (30) days of the initial disclosure and delivered to the recipient), or that due to the nature of the information the recipient would clearly understand it to be confidential information of the disclosing party; and (d) the specific terms and conditions of these Terms, and any amendment and attachment thereof, between the parties.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Confidentiality Obligation. Each party (as the receiving party) must: (i) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties except as permitted by these Terms; and (ii) only use the other party’s Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under these Terms. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its, and its Affiliates’, employees, agents or contractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for okSign, includes providing the Services and sharing with the subcontractors referenced herein) provided that the party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 10 and that these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than these Terms.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (i) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was known by the receiving party before it received the Confidential Information; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosing Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so on breach of this Section 10, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS.<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">ALL okSign SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 11 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. CUSTOMER AND SITE VISITORS MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Customer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold okSign, our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, suppliers, consultants, and agents harmless from any and all third party claims, liability, damages, and costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees) arising from or related to, as applicable: (a) Customer’s access to and use of the Site; (b) violation of these Terms by Customer or its Authorized Users, as applicable; (c) infringement of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity by Customer; (d) the nature and content of all Customer Data processed by the okSign; (e) Customer’s authentication of end user(s), participant(s) or, signer(s), or (f) any products or services purchased or obtained by Customer.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">okSign retains the exclusive right to settle, compromise and pay, without Customer’s prior consent, any and all claims or causes of action which are brought against us. okSign reserves the right, at Customer’s expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which Customer is required to indemnify okSign and Customer agrees to cooperate with our defense of these claims. Customer agrees not to settle any matter in which we are named as a defendant and/or for which Customer has indemnity obligations without our prior written consent. okSign will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Disclaimer of Consequential Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL okSign OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Cap on Damages. okSign’S AND ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO okSign FOR THE APPLICABLE okSign SERVICE OR RELATED SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES, okSign’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50 US).</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Exceptions. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 13. IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THESE TERMS, THIS SECTION 13 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Failure of Essential Purpose. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 13 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, ANY okSign SERVICE OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS AND CONTENT.<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">okSign may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other third-party websites, services, or resources that are beyond our control. okSign is not responsible for these third-party products or content. okSign makes no representations or warranties as to the quality, suitability, functionality, or legality of any third-party products or third-party content to which links may be provided, and you hereby waive any claim you might have against us with respect to such. Customer agrees that okSign is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such third-party products or third-party content.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">GENERAL.<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Assignment. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign these Terms without the advance written consent of the other party, except that okSign may assign these Terms without consent to an Affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition, or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign these Terms except as expressly authorized under this Section 15.1 will be void.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Notices. Any notice or communication under these Terms must be in writing. Customer must send any notices under these Terms (including breach notices) to okSign, in English, at the following address, info@oksign.app, and include “Attention: Legal Department” in the subject line. okSign may send notices to the email addresses on Customer’s account or, at okSign’s option, to Customer’s last-known postal address. okSign may also provide operational notices regarding the okSign Service or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of the notice on okSign’s website or the okSign Service. Each party consents to receiving electronic notices. okSign is not responsible for any automatic filtering Customer or its network provider may apply to emails.</li>

									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Subpoenas. Nothing in these Terms prevents okSign from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but okSign will use good faith efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Independent Contractors.

									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligation under these Terms (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Export Control. Customer acknowledges that the okSign Services, documentation, website, and all related products, information, technology, and software are subject to export control laws and regulations of the United States (including, but not limited to, the US Export Administration Act, sanction regulations from the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control [“OFAC”]), and of other jurisdictions. Customer is responsible for obtaining any required export or import authorizations for use of the okSign Services. Customer represents and warrants that it, its Affiliates, and its Authorized Users are not on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country.

									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">MANDATORY ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS. IF YOU ARE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:<ul>
											<li>We Both Agree to Arbitrate. You and okSign agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</li>
											<li>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate within 30 days of first registering your account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@okSign.app">info@okSign.app</a></li>
											<li>Arbitration Procedures and Fees. The arbitration will be held in person in Canada</li>
											<li>NO CLASS ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be deemed void.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Amendments; Waivers. Any modification or amendment to these Terms must be made in writing and executed by an authorized representative of each party. However, if okSign modifies these Terms or any applicable Service Specific Terms during Customer’s Subscription Term, the modified version will take effect upon Customer’s next Subscription Term renewal. In addition: (a) If okSign launches new products or optional features that require opt-in acceptance of new terms, those terms will apply upon Customer’s acceptance or use; (b) changes to any terms will take effect immediately for Free Access Subscriptions; and (c) during a Subscription Term, okSign may update okSign’s Security page, Privacy Policy, Acceptable Use Policy, and Service Specific Terms from time-to-time to reflect process improvements or changing practices, and these changes will take effect thirty (30) days from the date of posting so long as they do not substantially diminish Customer’s rights or create substantial additional Customer obligations during a Subscription Term. okSign’s documentation is available online and constantly being developed and improved, and as a result, during a Subscription Term okSign may update the documentation to reflect best practice with the relevant okSign Service, provided that these changes do not substantially diminish Customer’s rights or create substantial Customer obligations. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any order form, these Terms will take precedence unless otherwise expressly provided. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under these Terms. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. The waiver by either you or okSign of any breach of any provision of these Terms does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to these Terms to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with these Terms will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of these Terms.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Severability. If any provision of these Terms is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms may otherwise remain in effect.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in these Terms confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of these Terms. Customer acknowledges that each Order Form only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Order Form(s) as the Customer, and not any Customer Affiliates.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Entire Agreement. These Terms represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the subject matter of these Terms. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the okSign Service or any other subject matter covered by these Terms. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to these Terms. Any terms provided by Customer (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Customer) are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Governing Law &amp; Venue. These terms will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada</li>
