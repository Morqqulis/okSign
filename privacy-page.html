									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Information you provide to us. When registering for or using the okSign Services we collect personal information provided by you. For example, when you create a okSign account, you may provide us with your name, account name, alias, employment-related information (to the extent you are using an employer’s business account), email address and a password, your phone number, your address and an electronic image of your signature (“Account information”).</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">You may provide us with personal information about other individuals when you use our Service, such as when you send or receive a signature request/workflow transaction, share information about such transactions, or ask others to electronically sign documents (“Your content”). You may also provide us with access to your contacts (“Contacts”) to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate with others, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. Contacts’ information may include personal information such as a real name, alias or email address. If you share your contracts with us, we will store those contacts on our servers for you to use.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Information that we collect automatically. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating, and signing documents) (“Usage information”). We use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and to protect okSign users. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, unique personal identifiers or online identifiers, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices (“Device information”). Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. For example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Information that we collect from third parties. We may share and/or collect additional information about you from third parties primarily to assist us in understanding how we can maintain and improve the services we offer to better serve you. We collect information like your purchasing or consuming history or tendencies, including products or services purchased, obtained or considered (“Commercial information”).</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">For example:<ul>
											<li>Analytics: We use services like Google Analytics and Heap, which use cookies and other tracking technologies to gather usage data that allows us to improve our products and services.</li>
											<li>Advertising: We use certain Google advertising features including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and Remarketing. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show okSign's ads on sites across the Internet. You may opt out at any time <a target="_blank" href="adssettings.google.com/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://myadcenter.google.com/?sasb=true" rel="noreferrer">adssettings.google.com/</a>). We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website.</li>
											<li>We partner with third parties to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, click <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="noreferrer">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> [or if located in the European Union click <a target="_blank" href="https://youronlinechoices.eu/" rel="noreferrer">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>]. Please note you may continue to receive generic ads.</li>
											<li>Mobile: We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the application.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Information we collect and process on behalf of you. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose for which you have engaged okSign. When you use our Services, we process and store certain information on your behalf as a data processor. For example, when a customer uploads documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process information on the customer’s behalf and in accordance with the customer’s instructions. In this situation, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the information.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">okSign acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. okSign has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete data should direct their questions to okSign’s customers (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe. If you have any questions or concerns about how information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, we recommend contacting the relevant customer.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. We may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote okSign services.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">okSign and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Website or Services.</li>

									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">We may also combine the information we collect (or that is otherwise provided to us) through aggregation and other means to limit the identification of any particular individual to help with our business goals (such as research and marketing).</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge. These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services. If you register for our Services, we may, from time to time, send you information about upgrades. Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time. If you don’t want to receive a particular type of marketing material from us, click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in the corresponding emails, or contact us using the contact details provided below (if using the contact details please provide your complete name, e-mail address, and any other relevant information that may be required to respond to your request). Please note that such marketing opt-out does not impact any transactional or operational notices that we may need to send you.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">We sometimes contact people who don’t have an okSign account. For recipients in the EU, we or a third party will obtain consent before reaching out. If you receive an email and no longer wish to be contacted by okSign, you can unsubscribe and remove yourself from our contact list via the message itself.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Bases for processing your information. We collect and use the personal data described above in order to provide you with the Services in a reliable and secure manner. We also collect and use personal data for our legitimate business needs. To the extent we process your personal data for other purposes, we ask for your consent in advance or require that our partners obtain such consent.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">HOW WE MAY SHARE YOUR INFORMATION<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">We do not sell your information. We may share your personally identifiable information as described below:<ul>
											<li>Vendors and other third-party service providers: We may share your information with third parties that we use for the business purposes of helping us to provide and support our Services. These parties provide services such as authentication, billing and collections, customer support, or data storage. We enter into legally binding agreements with these third-party service providers that protect your personal information and forbids such providers from using your information for their own purposes. These third parties (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.okSign.com/subprocessors" rel="noreferrer">https://www.okSign.com/subprocessors</a>) will access your information to perform tasks on our behalf, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions.</li>
											<li>okSign has collected and disclosed the following categories of personal information, as described above, to vendors and third-party service providers in the preceding 12 months:<ul>
													<li>Account Information: includes your identifying information, which could be your real name, alias, unique personal identifier or online identifier, and it could include other personal information like your postal address, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name or similar identifiers.</li>
													<li>Commercial information: such as your purchasing or consuming history or tendencies, including products or services purchased, obtained or considered.</li>
													<li>Your content: what you and your users decide to input into the fields in the okSign and HelloWorks forms that you create and/or fill out.</li>
													<li>Contacts: includes identifying information about contacts that you’ve chosen to give us access to, like a real name, alias or email address.</li>
													<li>Usage information: includes information relating to your use of the Services. Because okSign provides online services, this may include internet or other electronic network activity information, such as information regarding your interaction with websites, applications, or advertisements.</li>
													<li>Device information: information about the particular devices you use to access the Services, which may include Usage information or device-specific information, such as an online identifier or Internet Protocol address, or geolocation data.</li>
													<li>Cookies and other technologies: technologies like cookies and pixel tags. These technologies can lead to the collection of online identifiers, Internet Protocol address, or other similar identifiers, as well as Usage information.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>Compliance with Law, Safety, Security, and Business Transactions: We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or appropriate government request; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of okSign or our users; (d) protect okSign’s rights, property, safety, or interest; or (e) perform a task carried out in the public interest.</li>
											<li>To other persons with your consent (e.g. fulfilling your fax or signature requests).</li>
											<li>Other users: Our Services display information like your name, profile picture, device, email address, and usage information to other users you collaborate or choose to share with. When you register your okSign account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information - like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address - visible to other users on the same domain. This helps you sync up with teams you can join, and helps other users share files and documents with you.</li>
											<li>If you choose to opt-in to okSign updates or marketing, we will email you with updates and offers, or inform you about other services and features.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>

							<li class="privacy-policy-detail-item">RETENTION OF INFORMATION<ul class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-list">
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, for legal, tax or regulatory reasons, or other lawful purposes.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</li>

									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">Data Transfers. When transferring data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, okSign relies upon a variety of legal mechanisms, such as contracts with our customers and affiliates, <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" rel="noreferrer">Standard Contractual Clauses</a>, and the European Commission's <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" rel="noreferrer">adequacy decisions</a> about certain countries, as applicable.</li>
									<li class="privacy-policy-detail-sub-item">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. okSign complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss–U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although okSign does not rely on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks as a legal basis for transfers of personal data. okSign has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.
